# mvc_pattern_try
after learning what is a mvc pattern in PHP , i tried to make this project in MVC

### Description 

the application that i was building it was about dislaying images from a database so that is you're interested on one of them you can contact the admis and have an appointement with the artist
the user can : -create his profil , edit his profil and delete it but can not interract with the item directly 

in this project we have admis , they're the ones allow to interract with item and they have power over the users so that they can delete one

### user 
the user for having access to the site he has to register , after registration he will have access than access is limited meaning he can see and all items available have an option to see more meaning to see the description of the item chosen and contact form if he want to know more about it 

### admis
he doesnt have a beautiful screen just having tables with all data inside like number , name and description of items ,name and email for users he can edit them , delete them 
have a option to go to the user pages and can create other admis only if they know not everyone can to that

### item
it contents name , description and image can be created , edited , updated or deleted only by an admis and have a create day in the admis pannel
